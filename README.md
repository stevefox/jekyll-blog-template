creating blogs and static website content using `markdown`.

 ## Prerequisites

* Install `docker`, `make` and `git`

## Quick Start

```
make init-blog
make serve && firefox localhost:4000
```

You can serve the `build/` directory as static html on any webserver, or using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
