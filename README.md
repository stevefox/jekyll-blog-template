## Prerequisites
 * Install docker, make and git

## Quick Start

make init-blog
make serve && firefox localhost:4000

## Publishing to Github Pages

I like to use git subtree for this, but you could also use a
submodule, keeping your source repo private (for drafts, notes, etc..)
and your build repo public on github.com.
